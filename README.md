### What is WEBRTC
WebRTC stands for "Web Real-Time Communication," and it is a technology standard and set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that enables real-time communication over the internet. WebRTC is designed to facilitate audio and video communication, as well as data sharing, directly between web browsers and other compatible applications without the need for plugins or additional software/servers.
It is uses User Datagram Protocal(UDP) for transmission of data instead of TCP,therefore it is favourable for video calling but not as much suggested for data sharing as data may leads to corrupt.It also posses limitations like only two people can communicate at a time and ecosystem complexity.
